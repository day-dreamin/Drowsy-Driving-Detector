HOW TO RUN:
1. Open cmd
2. Run `streamlit run frontend.py`
3. Go to http://localhost:8501 in Chrome

NOTE:
You can also access a hosted instance at https://cs5131-drowsy.streamlit.app/.
However, it may be very laggy if your network connection is slow, as it streams data to a remote server in realtime.
Also as I am using a free plan for remote service, if it doesn't work, it means the quota might have been exceeded.
